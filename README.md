# Yelp Natural Language Processing

# Abstract 
Building unsupervised Natural Language Processing (NLP) machine learning models to predict whether a business review text is positive or negative. Also, assigns topics(clustering) based on the raw text data to find out the business domains and implement a recommendation system.




# Methodology
1. EDA (cleaning and visualizing the data).
2. NLP(Pre-processing).
3. Topic models.
4. Recommendation system.
5. Classification models.

 



# Data
Two separate datasets were imported from Yelp in json format. The first data contains the user's review text the other one contains the business names. The two datasets were merged and a sample of 15000 observations was selected.




# Tools
• Technologies: Python using Jupyter notebook.

• Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Pickle and Nltk.
